TheraMind is a mental wellness companion web app built with Next.js that was created as our final project for the Devscale Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. Working in a team of four as the project lead, I was responsible for AI integration, frontend development, and ensuring successful feature implementation.

The application helps users track their daily moods, interact with an AI-powered chatbot that responds based on their emotional state, and provides personalized mental wellness content. Built with a mobile-first approach, TheraMind represents our team's ability to develop a complex, full-stack application under real-world constraints.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features

#### 1. Mood Tracking System

Multi-step form with state persistence across pages using React Context API. User mood data is stored with timestamps for pattern analysis.

#### 2. AI-Powered Chatbot

Integration with OpenAI API to provide contextual responses based on user's mood input. System prompts dynamically adjust based on mood state to offer appropriate support.

#### 3. Authentication & Data Privacy

Implemented Arctic Auth for secure user authentication. All mood data and journal entries are private and linked to user accounts with proper data encryption.

#### 4. Multi-page Form State Management

Created system to maintain form state across multiple screens (mood input, journaling, recap) with a final submission that combines all data into a single POST request.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- Next.js 14 with App Router for optimized routing and server components
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Context API for multi-page form state management
- MDX for dynamic content rendering in blog section

### Backend

- Next.js API routes for serverless functions
- PostgreSQL database for structured data storage
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database queries
- OpenAI API integration for chatbot functionality

### Authentication

- Arctic Auth for user authentication and profile management
- JWT tokens for secure API requests
- Role-based access control for admin features

### Deployment

- Vercel for hosting and continuous deployment
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Automated testing via CI/CD pipeline

## Challenges & Solutions

### Technical Challenges

#### 1. Multi-page Form State Management

**Challenge:** Maintaining state across multiple pages (mood input, journaling, recap) while only POSTing data after completing all steps.

**Solution:** Implemented React Context API to store form data across all steps and created a final submission function that combines all data into a single POST request. This preserved user progress while ensuring data integrity.

#### 2. AI Integration & Context Preservation

**Challenge:** Creating a chatbot that remembered user's mood input and provided appropriate responses based on emotional state.

**Solution:** Developed dynamic system prompts that incorporated the user's mood data into each API call, allowing the AI to maintain context throughout the conversation and provide more relevant support.

#### 3. Performance Optimization

**Challenge:** Initial AI responses were slow, causing a poor user experience, especially on mobile devices.

**Solution:** Implemented streaming responses from the OpenAI API and added optimistic UI updates to show typing indicators. Also utilized Next.js server components where appropriate to improve initial load times.

### 4. Project Management Challenges

**Challenge:** All team members were employed full-time, leaving limited hours for project development and causing timeline pressures.

**Solution:** Implemented strict prioritization using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have). Created a detailed sprint plan with clearly defined responsibilities and daily async standups via Slack.

#### 5. Communication & Task Overlap

**Challenge:** Miscommunication led to task overlap where multiple team members worked on the same features unknowingly.

**Solution:** Established a more robust GitHub workflow with feature branches and pull request reviews. Implemented a shared Notion board for task tracking with clear ownership assignments.

#### 6. Team Motivation

**Challenge:** Maintaining team motivation through technical difficulties and tight deadlines while everyone balanced full-time jobs.

**Solution:** As project lead, I focused on leading by example, taking on challenging tasks first to demonstrate feasibility. Scheduled regular celebration of small wins and implemented pair programming sessions to tackle difficult problems together.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Growth

Gained hands-on experience with modern web development practices including Next.js App Router, React Context API, and API integration. Learning to manage state across multi-page forms was particularly valuable.

### Project Management

Developed practical leadership skills by managing a remote team with limited availability. Learned how crucial clear communication, documentation, and task prioritization are to project success.

### Problem-Solving

Enhanced ability to tackle complex technical challenges through research, experimentation, and collaboration. Documentation reading skills improved significantly by necessity, a crucial skill for any developer.

## Conclusion

TheraMind represents more than just a bootcamp final projectâ€”it was a transformative learning experience that pushed our technical and collaborative skills to new heights. Despite working within the constraints of full-time jobs and limited experience, our team delivered a functioning mental wellness application with meaningful features.

As project lead, I'm particularly proud of how we overcame both technical and logistical challenges through persistence and teamwork. The experience of building a multi-step form with state management across pages, integrating AI capabilities, and coordinating remote development has provided invaluable lessons that will serve us all in our future development careers.
