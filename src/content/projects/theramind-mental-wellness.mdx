# Project Overview

TheraMind represents a new approach to digital mental wellness, combining emotion tracking, AI-powered conversations, and personalized content discovery in one comprehensive platform. Built for Devscale, this application provides users with 24/7 access to mental health support and resources.

## The Challenge

Mental health support often faces significant barriers:

- **Accessibility**: Limited access to mental health professionals
- **Cost**: High costs of traditional therapy sessions
- **Stigma**: Reluctance to seek help due to social stigma
- **Timing**: Mental health crises don't follow business hours
- **Consistency**: Difficulty maintaining regular self-care routines
- **Personalization**: One-size-fits-all approaches don't work for everyone

## The Solution

I designed and developed TheraMind as a comprehensive digital companion that addresses these challenges through intelligent technology and thoughtful user experience design.

### Core Features

- Customizable tracking categories for personal relevance

#### AI-Powered Therapeutic Conversations

- Natural language processing for empathetic responses
- Context-aware conversations that remember user history
- Evidence-based therapeutic techniques integrated into dialogue
- Crisis detection with appropriate resource recommendations

#### Personalized Content Discovery

## User Experience Design
