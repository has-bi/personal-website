Youvit, Indonesia's leading gummy vitamin brand, faced a customer service challenge: with only one nutritionist available during business hours, they couldn't effectively handle the volume of customer inquiries coming in 24/7.

Nutritalk was created as a WhatsApp-based AI assistant that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate nutritional guidance and product information instantly, at any time of day. By moving from a traditional web interface to Indonesia's most popular messaging platform, we achieved a 98% increase in user adoption.

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Platform Adoption

**Problem:** Initial web-based version had low adoption rates as users didn't want to visit a dedicated site.

**Solution:** Moved to WhatsApp integration via Wati.io, enabling customers to get answers through a platform they already use daily.

### Knowledge Structure

**Problem:** Creating an effective knowledge base that could provide accurate nutrition information for different products and demographics.

**Solution:** Implemented a three-category structure (General, Ingredients, Benefits) with RAG to search across all categories and combine results intelligently.

### Team Capabilities

**Problem:** Youvit lacked developers who could maintain a complex custom system long-term.

**Solution:** Used n8n for workflow automation, allowing non-technical team members to monitor and maintain the system through a visual interface rather than code.

### System Architecture

Nutritalk uses a pragmatic architecture designed for both effectiveness and maintainability:

- **WhatsApp Integration:** Wati.io handles messaging on the platform most Indonesians use daily
- **n8n Workflows:** Visual automation platform manages the entire process flow
- **Qdrant Vector DB:** Stores and retrieves knowledge across multiple categories
- **RAG Implementation:** Combines search results with GPT-4o for natural responses
