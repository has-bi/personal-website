# Project Overview

NutriTalk revolutionized Youvit's customer service by creating an AI-powered nutrition assistant accessible through WhatsApp - Indonesia's most popular messaging platform. This intelligent system provides 24/7 personalized vitamin and nutrition guidance, dramatically improving customer satisfaction and engagement.

## The Challenge

Youvit's customer service team was overwhelmed with repetitive nutrition questions:

- **Response Delays**: Long wait times leading to customer frustration
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Inconsistent answers from different support agents
