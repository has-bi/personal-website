# Project Overview

In the competitive world of enterprise business, manual purchase order processing often requires dedicated staff members, leading to significant labor costs. This case study reveals how Youvit revolutionized their purchase order management system by transitioning from manual processing to intelligent automation, achieving remarkable cost efficiency and operational improvements.

Before automation, Youvit allocated a full-time staff member to handle purchase order processing, incurring a monthly salary cost of **5.5M IDR**. This staff member spent countless hours manually processing purchase orders from multiple distributors, each using different formats and submission methods. Beyond the salary costs, this manual approach tied up valuable human resources in repetitive tasks that could be automated.

## The Challenge

### The Company Challenge

Before implementing automation, Youvit faced common challenges in purchase order management that many businesses struggle with today. Their team spent countless hours manually processing purchase orders from multiple distributors, each using different formats and submission methods. This labor-intensive process consumed valuable resources and introduced risks of human error in data entry.

**The financial impact was significant:** a full-time staff member dedicated to purchase order processing represented not just the monthly salary cost, but also the opportunity cost of having skilled personnel tied up in repetitive, manual tasks that could be automated.

### The Developer Challenge

As a developer, I faced a complex challenge in creating an automated purchase order processing system. The core technical hurdles included:

- **Multi-format processing**: Extracting data from 7 different distributor formats (with ongoing growth)
- **Robust preprocessing pipeline**: Developing systems that could handle diverse document structures
- **Gmail integration**: Automatically retrieving attachments and parsing emails
- **Document detection algorithms**: Sophisticated email parsing and document detection
- **Flexible data extraction**: Each distributor's unique format demanded an intelligent, adaptive approach

Each distributor's unique format demanded a flexible, intelligent data extraction approach that could adapt to varying document layouts while maintaining accuracy and reliability.

## The Solution

### System Architecture Overview

PO Tracker leverages Google Cloud Platform's powerful suite of tools to create an end-to-end automated document processing pipeline. The system combines multiple cloud services to achieve seamless operation from email ingestion to data analytics.

### Core Components

**Cloud Scheduler**: PO Tracker runs every hour from 7 AM to 7 PM, Monday to Friday, using Google Cloud Scheduler to check for new emails automatically. This ensures timely processing during business hours while conserving resources during off-peak times.

**Cloud Functions**: A cloud function scans email inboxes for new POs, downloads PDFs, splits them into pages, and stores them in distributor-specific Cloud Storage buckets. This serverless approach ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness.

**Document AI**: Document AI extracts important information from PDFs using Google's advanced machine learning models. Custom rules validate and clean data for each distributor's unique format, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

**BigQuery Integration**: Processed data connects to BigQuery for analytics, allowing teams to track distributor stock, sales performance, and SLAs. This transforms raw purchase order data into actionable business intelligence.

## How It Works

### 1. Automated Email Monitoring

The system continuously monitors designated email accounts for incoming purchase orders. Using intelligent filtering, it identifies relevant emails containing PDF attachments from known distributors, ensuring only valid purchase orders enter the processing pipeline.

### 2. Document Processing Pipeline

Once a purchase order is detected:

- PDFs are automatically downloaded and securely stored
- Multi-page documents are intelligently split for individual processing
- Files are organized into distributor-specific Cloud Storage buckets
- Document AI processes each page for comprehensive data extraction

### 3. Intelligent Data Extraction

Document AI utilizes custom-trained models to:

- Recognize different distributor formats automatically
- Extract key information (items, quantities, prices, dates)
- Apply distributor-specific validation rules
- Clean and normalize data for consistency across all formats

### 4. Data Integration and Analytics

Processed data flows seamlessly into BigQuery, where teams can:

- Track inventory levels across distributors
- Monitor order fulfillment timelines
- Analyze purchasing patterns and trends
- Generate automated reports and alerts for better decision-making

## Results & Impact

The implementation of PO Tracker delivered transformative results across multiple business metrics:

### Additional Benefits

- **24/7 Availability**: Unlike human operators, the system processes orders continuously during configured business hours
- **Scalability**: Handles increasing volumes without additional staffing costs
- **Consistency**: Standardized processing eliminates variations in data entry approaches
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all processing activities for compliance and troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation

### Google Cloud Architecture

The solution leverages several GCP services in a coordinated workflow:

**Cloud Storage**: Provides secure, scalable storage for processed documents with intelligent organization by distributor and processing status.

**Cloud Functions**: Serverless compute handles email parsing, document preprocessing, and coordination between services. Written in Python with robust error handling and comprehensive logging.

**Document AI**: Custom processor models trained specifically for purchase order formats. Continuous learning improves accuracy over time as new document variations are encountered.

**BigQuery**: Data warehouse enables complex analytics and reporting. Optimized schemas support rapid querying across millions of processed orders.

### Distributor Format Handling

Each of the seven supported distributors required unique processing approaches:

- **Format Recognition**: Automated detection of distributor type based on document layout and content patterns
- **Field Mapping**: Custom extraction rules for each distributor's specific field locations and naming conventions
- **Validation Logic**: Distributor-specific business rules ensure data quality and catch anomalies
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when documents don't match expected formats

### Scalability and Maintenance

The system is designed for growth and long-term reliability:

- **Modular Architecture**: New distributors can be added without disrupting existing processing
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Comprehensive logging and alerting ensure issues are quickly identified and resolved
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient resource usage keeps operating costs minimal even as volume scales
- **Security Compliance**: Enterprise-grade security protects sensitive business data throughout the pipeline
